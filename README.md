## Description:
Create a basic to-do list application that allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and remove them. This project will help you practice working with data storage, user input, and basic user interface concepts.

## Features:

Task Management:

Add tasks with a title and description.
Mark tasks as completed.
Remove tasks.
Data Storage:

Store tasks in a data structure (e.g., list, dictionary).
Save tasks to a file to persist data between sessions.
Load tasks from the file when the application starts.
User Interface:

Create a simple command-line interface using text-based menus.
Display the list of tasks with their status (pending or completed).
Allow users to interact with the application through text commands (e.g., add, complete, remove).
Error Handling:

Implement basic error handling to handle incorrect user inputs gracefully.
Optional Enhancements:

Prioritize tasks and display them in order of priority.
Add due dates to tasks.
Implement color-coding for different task statuses.
Create a graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like Tkinter or PyQt for a more interactive experience.
